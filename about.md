## Objectives
Promote individual computing abilities by the organization of 10 workshops per year. Workshops will be developed and organized by the RIVE graduate students.

Showcase the RIVE's abilities by the creation of this website, containing a recap of all numerical methods developed or teached during the workshops, as well a those developed by the RIVE's members during their own research activities.
