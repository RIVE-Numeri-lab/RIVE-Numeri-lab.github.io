# 2023-2024 Calendar

After holding our annual meeting, we are preparing the detailed calendar for our 2023-2024 season.

Without promising you anything, this season should be full of variety, including:

- deep learning ChatGPT style
- cartography with QGIS
- collaboration with git
- graphics with ggplot2
- machine learning with XGBoost
- qualitative analysis with NVivo

See you soon
