# The Numérilab website is finally bilingual!

By popular demand, the Numérilab website is finally available in French.

The architecture of the site has been completely reworked. The content of the majority of
pages is now available in the language of Molière.

Only a few workshops are currently available in French, but this
archive is expected to grow rapidly as instructors
will have time to adapt their workshops.
