# 2025-2026 Update

Following our annual meeting, the Numérilab has now formed its student committee for 2025-2026.

This year, it will see the return of Jade Dormoy-Boulanger and Jessika Malko, as well as the arrival of Esteban Hamel-Jomphe, Thierry Laurent-St-Pierre, and Charles Gagnon. These newcomers complete the largest student committee since its inception.

Our calendar has also been updated with the first three events of the season, starting on September 25th. The remainder of the calendar, for 2026, will be announced later this fall.

See you soon.
