# Introduction to GIS
Today we will look at some facilities with GIS software like QGIS. The following examples are also possible to do with others GIS softwares like ArcMap. 


## Import data
First thing we want to make is to import data like maps, tables, rasters or so on. To begin, start QGIS on your computer.


```1_import_data
#Open QGIS-->Layer--> Add Layer-->Add Raster Layer (for raster or picture mostly) or Add Vector Layer (for lines polygons or any shapefiles) 

```

## Buffers
An easy operation to do with GIS is to make buffers zones around differents attributes. Those buffers will be over an existing vector layer you will have selected. 


```2_buffer
#Vector--> Geoprocessing Tools--> Buffer
## Apply the distance you want.
## Check the "Dissolve result" box to have cleaner result.

```
![](/assets/photos_atelier/buffer.PNG)

It is good to know that you could put a negative distance in your buffer to reduce a polygon area for example. 

If you do a buffer for analysis only, a temporary file will be create by QGIS. Otherwise you could also save the layer somewhere on your computer.

## Georeferencing a picture

An interesting tool is the georefencing of a picture. For example, you take a picture of a map then you can project it somewhere you want or with others layers to get complementary informations.

The first step is to activate the georeferencer in QGIS


```3_pluggin_georeferencer
#Pluggin--> Manage and Install Pluggin--> Installed--> Check the "Georeferencer GDAL"
```

Then you should see the geoferencer sign in the raster panel.

The next step will be to reference the picture with the georeferencer.


```4_georeferencer
#Georeferencer--> Add Raster--> Specify projection (i.e: EPSG 4326)--> Add reference points --> Specify the type of transformation (projective in the case of a picture)

##You can add reference points by clicking somewhere you know in the picture then for the coordinates click "From Map Canvas" and it will allow you to select directly the point from the layer you want to match in your QGIS project.
```

## Import data to a GPS
An interesting option from QGIS is to import data from shapefiles to a GPS device. Here we will see an example to import data to a garmin GPS. 
We can divide this task in 2 steps. First step is to import points to the device then we will import the map background. 

```5_import_data
#We will need the POI exporter pluggin and a symbol will appear. You can click on it to launch the pluggin. 

# 1) Give the file emplacement --> 2) select the layer in the file --> 3) Default category name :Give the name of the output file --> 4) Select colummn to be used as POI name: The field that identify the name of the points. 
```

For the map backgroup another pluggin is mandatory. In the case of a Garmin device, use the pluggin "GarminCustomMap".
This pluggin will take a printscreen of the map canvas you project on QGIS and it will transform it in a .KMZ file which can be import to a Garmin GPS.



```5_1_map_background
#Launch the pluggin by clicking on it.--> Save the file anywhere you want on your computer --> Ajust the image quality (usually it can be ajust at the maximum resolution). 

```
![](/assets/photos_atelier/gps_custommap.PNG)

To transfert the points and the background into the GPS. Connect the GPS to your computer. You can copy-past the files you saved precedentely to the GPS. The points file will go in the GPX section and the map background in the GarminCustomMap file.

## Create a map

We can now take a look a the creation of a map with the software.


```6_create
#Project--> New print Layout--> Give a name to the map you will create

#The side toolbar will allow you import the map canvas, to zoom in or out from it, etc.

# The button "Add Item" in the  top menu allow you to add differents elements like a legend or a scale bar.

```

## Join information of differents layers

For example you have a dataset of points but another database with information about those points is in a CSV file appart. With a GIS you can usually link the information by joining the two tables of attributes and project it on a map. 


```7_join_layers
# Add the first layer with the spatial information, for example a shapefiles of points. 

# Go to Add Layer --> Add delimited Text Layer --> Choose the right file --> specify "no geometry" in the Geometry Definition

# Now the attributes tables is loaded --> Right click on it to see the properties --> Joins--> Add a new join with the "+" sign --> Select the type of join you want and the layer to join 
```

## Calculate zonals statistics

This example is about zonal statistic. This tool could be useful if you want to analyse a raster image. Rasters don't have attribute table. However, each pixel have a value, so we could put a vector layer like a grid over a raster and give a certain value to the part of the grid. 
In order to do that the steps are the following:
1)Add a raster layer
2)Create a grid of polygon to go over the raster
3)Calculate the zonal statistic for each polygon



```8_zonal_stats
#Add the raster layer you want.

#For the grid go to Vector--> Research Tools --> Create Grid --> Specify the type of grid you want (points, polygons, lines)--> For the grid extent use the 3 dot to select an existing layer extend --> Choose the horizontal and vertical spacing --> Ajust the CRS (spatial reference) if it's not the good one

# For the zonal statistic you can go in processing --> Toolbox--> Search for zonal statistic and click on it --> Select the raster layer you want to extract statistic from --> Select the vector layer containing zones (for example the grid you just made)--> Select the statistic you want to be calculate 

## This last step should have add a column in the table of attributes of the grid with the statistics you selected.
```

## Introduction to Model Builder

When it come to an iterative operation or something you know you will do often, maybe it could be an idea to think about a model builder. This tool will allow you to design your own model or cycle of operation. Then you can just run the model with the input layer you need instead of creating layers times after times.

Let's take the example of the previous grid and statistical analysis but we will put them in a model. 
The steps are the same but here we could add a classification of the polygons.

1)Add a raster layer
2)Create a grid of polygon to go over the raster
3)Calculate the zonal statistic for each polygon
4)Add a classification to the polygons in the grid from a calculated field


```9_model_builder
#Go to Processing --> Graphical Modeler --> Give a name to your model --> Add a Raster layer --> At the bottom select "algorithm" --> Create Grid --> Specify the grid detail like previously. --> The grid input will be the result of the raster you put in input.

# The next step is to select the zonal statistic, add it to the model and ajust the statistics like previously.  


# Now to have a calculated field --> Choose Field Calculator in the "algorithm" section --> Select the input layer and put the one from zonal statistics --> Name the new field like you want --> Specify the type of field (for here let's put integer)--> Type a name for the output layer you would like to have --> In the formula bar paste the following line of code without the # sign:
#CASE 
#WHEN "_mean"<=0.30 THEN 1
#WHEN "_mean" >0.30 and "_mean" <=0.35 THEN 2
#WHEN "_mean" >0.35 and "_mean" <=0.40 THEN 3
#WHEN "_mean" > 0.40 and "_mean" <=0.45 THEN 4
#WHEN "_mean" >0.45 and "_mean" <=0.55 THEN 5
#WHEN "_mean">0.55 THEN 6
#ELSE 0
#END

# This will allow to make categories in the zonal statistic you programmed before.

```

Here do not forget to save the model before launch it and then you will be ready to go
