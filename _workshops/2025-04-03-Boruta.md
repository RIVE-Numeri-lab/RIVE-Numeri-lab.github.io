The **Boruta** algorithm is a machine learning feature selection tool designed to select significant explicative values for a given model. Boruta is also a wrapper algorithm around Random Forests trees, meaning it uses the Random Forest trees classification method to train and evaluate a predictive model. Fun fact: **"Boruta"** comes from the slave mythology where Boruta is a forest spirit. 

The Boruta algorithm aims to provide a stable and ranked selection of important and non-important factors. To achieve this it compares median Z scores of the provided values for a given model to those of "shadow" features (features based on a strictly random distribution).

This algorithm offers several very interesting characteristics for disciplines related to environmental science : 

- Can be used with both continuous and categorical variables
- Due to its iterative nature, it deals well with correlations between explanatory variables (No need to care for this anymore!)
- It ranks the significant factors found
- It is very efficient when there is a lot of explicative values

Boruta also has some negative points:

- It does not work well with NAs in a dataset
- It is a relatively slow process to execute, especially when it's analyzing a big dataset

NB: Analysis presented into this tutorial make no sense on a scientific point of view. Theyr are just used as examples.

Now that we have a head round the Boruta algorithm, let's try it!


``` r
#Packages' installation and loading
#install.packages(c("Boruta", "Amelia", "randomForest", "sp", "pdp"))
library(Boruta)
library(Amelia)
library(randomForest)
library(sp)
library(pdp)

#Data
data("meuse") # Dataset on heavy metal pollution in the Meuse floodplain, Netherlands
```

## Step 1: Data Check

We need to check if our dataset has NAs and if categorical values are encoded as factors.


``` r
#Data check
str(meuse)  # Everything looks good, categorical values are factor encoded 
```

```

```

``` r
meuse <- meuse[, -c(1,2)] # getting rid the coordinates, since we don't need them

#Checking for NAs
missmap(meuse) #We have NAs!
```

``` r
#getting rid if the missing data
meuse <- na.omit(meuse) # Usually, we would have taken care of it differently, but for this workshop it works

missmap(meuse) #everything's fine, we move forward!
```

## Step 2: The test with a categorical response value (landuse)


``` r
set.seed(666) # Add some randomness and insure reproductive results

boruta.tree <- Boruta(landuse~.,meuse, doTrace = 2) # the test
```


``` r
getSelectedAttributes(boruta.tree, withTentative = F) #The results
```

```

``` r
result.boruta <- attStats(boruta.tree) # saving the results within an object
result.boruta # everything is comfirmed except ffreq (flooding frequency)

## Step 3: Results visualization


``` r
plot(boruta.tree.2, las = 2, cex.axis = 0.7) # red = rejected, blue = shadow, shadow = significant (the most important one is dist.m, the distance from the Meuse in meter)
```

![](/assets/Boruta_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)<!-- -->

``` r
#Now, what is the distance impact on the landuse?
#We will use a partial dependency plot

landuse<- randomForest(landuse~ ., meuse, importance = T) # we add the significant values found significant  

graph.landuse<- pdp::partial(landuse,pred.var = "dist.m", which.class = "W", plot=F)#generate the plot data for pasture
pdp::plotPartial(graph.landuse) # the plot, yhat = pasture probability, from 500 m and further away from the Meuse, We have drastically less probabilities of having a pasture
```

![](/assets/Boruta_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-7-2.png)<!-- -->

And what if we would like to plot a categorical explicative value? Let's try with soil types


``` r
graph.landuse<- pdp::partial(landuse,pred.var = "soil", which.class = "W", plot=F) #generate the plot data for pasture
pdp::plotPartial(graph.landuse) # the plot, yhat = pasture probability, we have more probabilities of finding pastures in a calcareous soil, followed by non-calcareous and red brick soils
```

## Step 4: The test with numerical value response (zinc)


``` r
set.seed(666) # Add some randomness and insure reproductive results

boruta.tree <- Boruta(zinc~.,meuse, doTrace = 2) # the test
```


``` r
getSelectedAttributes(boruta.tree, withTentative = F) #the results
```

```

```

``` r
result.boruta <- attStats(boruta.tree) # saving the results within an object
result.boruta # Everything is confirmed except landuse
