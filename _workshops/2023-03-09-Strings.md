# How is text constructed in R
Before embarking on the manipulation of text *per se*, it is important to understand the nature of text in R and how to construct it.

## How text is encoded in the computer
In R's memory, in CSV files, etc. the text is stored in a series of hexadecimal codes. We can indeed see the corresponding codes with the charToRaw function:


```r
charToRaw("Charles")
```

```
[1] 43 68 61 72 6c 65 73
```

The “C” is encoded with 43, the “h” with 68, etc.

If we do the mathematics of the thing, we quickly realize that this system can only represent 16*16 = 256 symbols. This worked well at a time when Americans had a hand in computing, but doesn't work at all for encoding text from any language in the world.

In the 1980s-1990s, a series of standards were developed to allow the encoding of characters other than English. Among other things, ISO-8859-1 (Latin1) allowed the encoding of most characters used in Western Europe, Latin2 in Eastern Europe, etc.

Today, there is an international standard, called UTF-8, which makes it possible to encode all imaginable characters, even Emojis!

Most modern software uses this encoding and the use of accents in files is no longer a problem. However, some older applications and some files produced some time ago do not necessarily adhere to this convention.

It is for this reason that sometimes, when loading a CSV file, you will see a series of weird characters in your data:

```r
read_csv("Latin1.csv")
```

```
Rows: 2 Columns: 3
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr (1): Col3
dbl (2): Col1, Col2

ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 3
   Col1  Col2 Col3            
  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>           
1     1     2 "All\xf4"       
2     3     4 "\xc0 la place?"
```
With trial and error, we can try to *guess* the correct encoding and specify it at load time:

```r
read_csv("Latin1.csv",locale = locale(encoding = "Windows-1252"))
```

```
Rows: 2 Columns: 3
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr (1): Col3
dbl (2): Col1, Col2

ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 3
   Col1  Col2 Col3       
  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>      
1     1     2 Allô       
2     3     4 À la place?
```

```r
read_csv("Latin1.csv",locale = locale(encoding = "Latin1"))
```

```
Rows: 2 Columns: 3
── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Delimiter: ","
chr (1): Col3
dbl (2): Col1, Col2

ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 3
   Col1  Col2 Col3       
  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>      
1     1     2 Allô       
2     3     4 À la place?
```

Usually, if you try Latin1, UTF-8, or Windows-1252, you're pretty sure you've got the right one.

Recent versions of the readr library now come with a feature that lets you let the computer do the dirty work for you:

```r
guess_encoding("Latin1.csv")
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 2
  encoding   confidence
  <chr>           <dbl>
1 ISO-8859-1       0.62
2 ISO-8859-2       0.41
```

## Manual text creation
Now, how can one do to create text in R?

The easiest way is to create a string object, like this:



## Création manuelle de texte
Maintenant, comment peut-on faire pour créer du texte dans R?

La façon la plus simple est de créer un objet chaîne de caractères, comme ceci : 

```r
chaine1 <- "Il faut l'essayer"
chaine2 <- 'Voici un autre "essai"'
```

Note that we can use the single or double quote to start and end our sequence.

In general, it is recommended to use the double quote, unless your character string contains more than one.

You can also include a double quote in a sequence started with a double quote, by using an escape character, i.e. the backslash (\):

```r
chaine3 <- "Je contient un \" et ça fonctionne tout de même"
```

Therefore, if you want to produce a backslash in a string, you must precede it with another backslash:

```r
backslash <- "\\"
```

Note that if you send one of these strings to the console, you will see the escape character:

```r
chaine3
```

```
[1] "Je contient un \" et ça fonctionne tout de même"
```

```r
backslash
```

```
[1] "\\"
```
This happens because, by default, R's print function (called implicitly) gives us not what it sees as text, but what we should type to reconstruct it.

If we want to see the true representation of the text (as we will see in graphics, etc.), we can use the str_view function. Compare these two outputs:

```r
print(c(chaine1, chaine2, chaine3))
```

```
[1] "Il faut l'essayer"                              
[2] "Voici un autre \"essai\""                       
[3] "Je contient un \" et ça fonctionne tout de même"
```

```r
str_view(c(chaine1, chaine2, chaine3))
```

```
[1] │ Il faut l'essayer
[2] │ Voici un autre "essai"
[3] │ Je contient un " et ça fonctionne tout de même
```

It is also possible to create so-called “raw” character strings, for which, when they are created, R does not try to manage escape characters. To do this, we must start our string with `r"(` and end it with `)"`

```r
complexe <- r"(L'apostrophe, le \ et même les "guillemets" ne posent plus de problèmes)"
str_view(complexe)
```

```
[1] │ L'apostrophe, le \ et même les "guillemets" ne posent plus de problèmes
```
As needed `r"()"` can be replaced with `r"[]"`, `r"{}"`, etc.

## Escape characters

Besides `\"` `\'` and `\\`, there are a series of other special characters when constructing text in R.

Among others : 

* `\n` adds line break
* `\t` adds an indent (tab)
* and `\u` et `\U` allow us to insert any unicode character


```r
str_view(c(
  "Saut\nde\nligne",
  "avec\tindentation",
  "\u00b5 mu",
  "\U0001f4a9 (sans commentaires)"
))
```

```
[1] │ Saut
    │ de
    │ ligne
[2] │ avec{\t}indentation
[3] │ µ mu
[4] │ 💩 (sans commentaires)
```

You can type `?'"'` at the R console for more details on the possibilities of escape characters.

## Creating text by programming

To create and combine text programmatically, there are three functions in the tidyverse, `str_c` and `str_glue` to work directly on objects (mutate, etc.) and `str_flatten` for cases where we try to summarize text.

The `str_c` function works like the c function, but for pasting chunks of text into a string, rather than pasting numbers into a vector.


```r
str_c("a","b","c")
```

```
[1] "abc"
```

```r
str_c("Salut ",c("Charles","Vincent"))
```

```
[1] "Salut Charles" "Salut Vincent"
```

Its operation is very similar to the `paste0` function, but its handling of missing values and vectors of different lengths (see previous example) is more consistent with all the other functions of the tidyverse.

Each element passed to str_c can of course be an object containing text, rather than the text itself:

```r
nom <- "Charles"
moment <- "aujourd'hui"
str_c("Bonjour ", nom, "! Comment allez-vous ", moment, "?")
```

```
[1] "Bonjour Charles! Comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?"
```

Although practical, this approach can become tedious if you have several pieces of text to put together and each time you have to close the quotation mark, add the comma, open the quotation mark, etc. without forgetting anything.

This is where the str_glue function comes in:

```r
str_glue("Bonjour {nom}, comment allez-vous {moment}?")
```

```
Bonjour Charles, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?
```

R will automatically replace each word enclosed in braces with the contents of the variable of the same name.


```r
noms <- c("Pierre","Paul","Jacques")
str_glue("Bonjour {noms}, comment allez-vous {moment}?")
```

```
Bonjour Pierre, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?
Bonjour Paul, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?
Bonjour Jacques, comment allez-vous aujourd'hui?
```
As you may see, `str_c` and `str_glue` will work great in contexts like a mutate where the function needs to produce a series of strings in response to a vector.

If our operation must imperatively return a single string, then we must use the `str_flatten` function:

```r
str_flatten(noms, ", ")
```

```
[1] "Pierre, Paul, Jacques"
```
You can also control the last separator to make nice enumerations:

```r
str_flatten(noms,", ",last = " et ")
```

```
[1] "Pierre, Paul et Jacques"
```


```r
habitats <- tribble(
  ~Espece,~Habitat,
  "A","désert",
  "A","forêt",
  "B", "forêt",
  "A", "tundra"
)
habitats %>% 
  group_by(Espece) %>% 
  summarize(
    Nombre = n(),
    Liste = str_flatten(Habitat,", ")
  )
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 3
  Espece Nombre Liste                
  <chr>   <int> <chr>                
1 A           3 désert, forêt, tundra
2 B           1 forêt                
```

# Text extraction
Another extremely common task that occurs in our R analyzes is having to extract textual information from already existing variables.

The tidyr library provides a series of functions designed expressly for this type of situation: the separate_ family, which includes 4 functions, namely:

* `separate_longer_delim`
* `separate_longer_position`
* `separate_wider_delim`
* `separate_wider_position`

In all cases, the functions will analyze the text contained in a variable, and separate it into pieces. Either by creating one observation per piece (_longer), or by creating one column per piece (_wider).

The splitting of the pieces can be based either on a separator (_delim), or on the position of the text (_position)

These functions are very useful, for example, when you have encoded information in the name of the sites in your experience:

```r
experience_a <- tibble(
  nom_site = c("CT01","CT02","CT03","TR01","TR02","TR03")
)
experience_a
```

```
# A tibble: 6 × 1
  nom_site
  <chr>   
1 CT01    
2 CT02    
3 CT03    
4 TR01    
5 TR02    
6 TR03    
```

All you have to do is provide the function with the number of characters in each of the pieces, with the name that this column should have corrected data frame.

```r
experience_a %>% 
  separate_wider_position(nom_site,c(traitement = 2, no_replicat = 2) )
```

```
# A tibble: 6 × 2
  traitement no_replicat
  <chr>      <chr>      
1 CT         01         
2 CT         02         
3 CT         03         
4 TR         01         
5 TR         02         
6 TR         03         
```

If our data had instead been in this format:

```r
experience_b <- tibble(
  nom_site = c("CT-1","CT-10","R-1","R-100")
)
experience_b
```

```
# A tibble: 4 × 1
  nom_site
  <chr>   
1 CT-1    
2 CT-10   
3 R-1     
4 R-100   
```
we could have extracted them based on the presence of the separator, like this:

```r
experience_b %>% 
  separate_wider_delim(nom_site,delim = "-",names = c("traitement","no_replicat"))
```

```
# A tibble: 4 × 2
  traitement no_replicat
  <chr>      <chr>      
1 CT         1          
2 CT         10         
3 R          1          
4 R          100        
```
Finally, it could happen that the information of several observations is
encoded in the same cell:

```r
experience_c <- tibble(
  site = c("A","B"),
  resultats_visites = c("0,0,1","1,0,1"),
  latitude = c(46,47),
  longitude = c(-72,-72.5)
)
experience_c
```

```
# A tibble: 2 × 4
  site  resultats_visites latitude longitude
  <chr> <chr>                <dbl>     <dbl>
1 A     0,0,1                   46     -72  
2 B     1,0,1                   47     -72.5
```
We can then use a _longer function to recreate each observation:

```r
experience_c %>% 
  separate_longer_delim(resultats_visites, delim = ",")
```

```
# A tibble: 6 × 4
  site  resultats_visites latitude longitude
  <chr> <chr>                <dbl>     <dbl>
1 A     0                       46     -72  
2 A     0                       46     -72  
3 A     1                       46     -72  
4 B     1                       47     -72.5
5 B     0                       47     -72.5
6 B     1                       47     -72.5
```
For simpler operations, you can also fetch directly
snippets of text with the str_sub function.

It allows you to use positive position numbers when you want to extract
from the beginning, and negative position numbers when we want to extract from
of the end :

```r
str_sub("LongTexte",5,9)
```

```
[1] "Texte"
```

```r
str_sub("LongTexte",-5, -1)
```

```
[1] "Texte"
```

# Regular expressions (regex)
Now that we have seen most of the functions for processing text programmatically, we are going to tackle a second way: regular expressions, commonly called by their acronym: regex!

Regex are sequences of characters that allow you to define a search pattern to use, in a very efficient way.

The price to pay for this efficiency is that regexes are sometimes difficult to read and debug. Some people call them black magic, because of their somewhat dark and unpredictable side. But well controlled, they are extremely powerful.

## Exploring with str_view
To facilitate our learning of regex, we will use a function that allows us to test them visually, the `str_view` function.

To illustrate our examples, we will use the name column of the msleep database, which is provided with the ggplot2 library


```r
head(msleep$name)
```

```
[1] "Cheetah"                    "Owl monkey"                
[3] "Mountain beaver"            "Greater short-tailed shrew"
[5] "Cow"                        "Three-toed sloth"          
```

To simplify life, however, we are going to extract all the names into a new vector, which we are also going to convert to lowercase

```r
noms <- msleep$name %>% str_to_lower()
head(noms)
```

```
[1] "cheetah"                    "owl monkey"                
[3] "mountain beaver"            "greater short-tailed shrew"
[5] "cow"                        "three-toed sloth"          
```

Basically, a regex is a sequence of characters to search for:

```r
str_view(noms,"shrew")
```

```
 [4] │ greater short-tailed <shrew>
[17] │ lesser short-tailed <shrew>
[73] │ musk <shrew>
[79] │ tree <shrew>
```

The str_view function shows us all the elements of the name vector that contained the searched sequence (“shrew”). Notice that in the output, the part that matched our regex has been surrounded by < >, and if you look at the output in the console, it will also be in a different color.

Note that regex are case sensitive. For example, the “SHREW” pattern does not return any results:

```r
str_view(noms, "SHREW")
```

## The construction of search sequences
In addition to the sequences of characters sought, a regex can also contain meta-characters allowing more precise control of the search.

The first one we will see is the `.` which, like a wildcard, can replace any character.

It can be used for example to find all names containing the word gray in English, regardless of whether it is written gray or grey:

```r
str_view(noms,"gr.y")
```

```
[32] │ <gray> seal
[33] │ <gray> hyrax
```

There are then three meta-characters to choose how many times each of the searched patterns should occur:

* `+` :  1 time or more (required)
* `?` :  0 or 1 time (optional)
* `*` :  0 or more (optional with possible repetition)

For example, all names containing an a followed by at least one s

```r
str_view(noms, "as+")
```

```
[21] │ <as>ian elephant
[26] │ pat<as> monkey
[47] │ northern gr<ass>hopper mouse
[59] │ c<as>pian seal
[67] │ e<as>tern american mole
[76] │ e<as>tern american chipmunk
```
Notice in this case that our pattern contains the second s in “grass hopper”

With the ?, the presence of the character becomes optional. We can catch for example all the nouns containing ham or am, like this:

```r
str_view(noms,"h?am")
```

```
[20] │ north <am>erican opossum
[27] │ western <am>erican chipmunk
[40] │ golden <ham>ster
[67] │ eastern <am>erican mole
[76] │ eastern <am>erican chipmunk
```
Finally, with the asterisk, you can make a pattern optional, even if it repeats itself. For example, we can search for all names containing “oo”, or with any number of p between the two o, like this:

```r
str_view(noms,"op*o")
```

```
[20] │ north american <opo>ssum
[35] │ mong<oo>se lemur
[37] │ thick-tailed <oppo>sum
[54] │ bab<oo>n
[61] │ potor<oo>
```

The square parentheses, on the other hand, allow you to define a series of alternatives that could be sought. For example, we can find all rats, cats and bats like this:

```r
str_view(noms,"[cbr]at")
```

```
[16] │ african giant pouched <rat>
[22] │ big brown <bat>
[28] │ domestic <cat>
[43] │ little brown <bat>
[44] │ round-tailed musk<rat>
[64] │ labo<rat>ory <rat>
[68] │ cotton <rat>
[69] │ mole <rat>
```

The circumflex accent makes it possible to reverse the condition of the square parenthesis. We could, for example, search for all the times where “at” appears, but it is not a cat or a rat:

```r
str_view(noms,"[^cr]at")
```

```
 [4] │ gr<eat>er short-tailed shrew
[11] │ g<oat>
[22] │ big brown <bat>
[26] │ <pat>as monkey
[43] │ little brown <bat>
```

One can also combine square parentheses and meta-characters defining the numbers of appearances. For example, we could search for all words containing two vowels followed by one or more consonants, like this:

```r
str_view(noms,"[aeiou][aeiou][^aeiou]+")
```

```
 [1] │ ch<eet>ah
 [3] │ m<ount><ain b><eav>er
 [4] │ gr<eat>er short-t<ail>ed shrew
 [6] │ thr<ee-t><oed sl>oth
 [7] │ northern fur s<eal>
 [8] │ vesper m<ous>e
[10] │ r<oe d><eer>
[11] │ g<oat>
[12] │ g<uin><ea p>ig
[16] │ african g<iant p><ouch>ed rat
[17] │ lesser short-t<ail>ed shrew
[19] │ tr<ee hyr>ax
[21] │ as<ian >elephant
[25] │ <eur>op<ean h>edgehog
[32] │ gray s<eal>
[35] │ mong<oos>e lemur
[37] │ thick-t<ail>ed opposum
[39] │ mongol<ian g>erbil
[42] │ h<ous>e m<ous>e
[44] │ r<ound-t><ail>ed muskrat
... and 18 more
```

Notice that in several instances, our pattern was found multiple times. Also notice that our definition of “consonant” is not quite right. As spaces are not vowels, they are also captured by our search pattern.

Another particularly useful special character is the vertical bar (|). The latter makes it possible to define alternative sequences (an OR). For example, to find all squirrels and chipmunks, one could write:

```r
str_view(noms,"squirrel|chipmunk")
```

```
[27] │ western american <chipmunk>
[66] │ <squirrel> monkey
[70] │ arctic ground <squirrel>
[71] │ thirteen-lined ground <squirrel>
[72] │ golden-mantled ground <squirrel>
[76] │ eastern american <chipmunk>
```

Note that our sequence also detected the Squirrel Monkey. We will see later how to remedy this problem.

## Regex-based functions
Now that we have seen the basic mechanics, we are going to do a brief overview of the functions allowing the use of regex.

To illustrate these functions well, we are going to create a small data frame containing the animal names in lowercase (as we used in the previous section) combined with another column of information to illustrate the application on data frames.


```r
tableau <- tibble(
  noms = noms,
  sommeil = msleep$sleep_total
)
```

The most practical application will undoubtedly be to combine the dplyr filter with the str_detect function.


```r
tableau %>% 
  filter(str_detect(noms, "squirrel|chipmunk"))
```

```
# A tibble: 6 × 2
  noms                           sommeil
  <chr>                            <dbl>
1 western american chipmunk         14.9
2 squirrel monkey                    9.6
3 arctic ground squirrel            16.6
4 thirteen-lined ground squirrel    13.8
5 golden-mantled ground squirrel    15.9
6 eastern american chipmunk         15.8
```

Another thing you will often want to do is replace the pattern found with something else. For example, if the experts finally decided that all chipmunks and squirrels were now called squimunks, we could do this:

```r
tableau %>% 
  mutate(
    noms = str_replace(noms,"squirrel|chipmunk","squimunk")
  ) %>% slice(70:80)
```

```
# A tibble: 11 × 2

Notice that I'm using the slice function to show you the rows where our replacement was made.

At the extreme, we could decide to replace all the “e” with another letter:

```r
tableau %>% 
  mutate(
    noms = str_replace(noms, "e","X")
  )
```

```
# A tibble: 83 × 2

```

As you can see, `str_replace` only changes the first instance found. To replace all instances, use the `str_replace_all` function:

```r
tableau %>% 
  mutate(
    noms = str_replace_all(noms, "e","X")
  )
```

```

If we leave the second argument empty (“”) in `str_replace`, we are essentially asking R to remove this sequence. It can sometimes be more elegant and readable in these cases to just use the `str_remove` (or `str_remove_all`) function. We could eliminate all the e's from our data like this:

```r
tableau %>% 
  mutate(
    noms = str_remove_all(noms, "e")
  )
```

```

There are dozens of other functions for working with regexes, including `str_subset`, `str_which`, and `str_count`, which I strongly encourage you to explore on your own.

## Escape characters (again!)
Okay, so if I had to ask you to write a regex to detect a period (.), what would you do?


```r
texte <- "Première phrase. Deuxième phrase."
str_view(texte,".")
```

```
[1] │ <P><r><e><m><i><è><r><e>< ><p><h><r><a><s><e><.>< ><D><e><u><x><i><è><m><e>< ><p><h><r><a><s><e><.>
```
Obviously not. A period is a wildcard, which can replace any character.

Maybe with an escape character?

```r
str_view(texte,"\.")
```

```
Error: '\.' is an unrecognized escape in character string starting ""\."
```
Ah no, it doesn't work because, when writing the string, R replaces the `\`-something by encoding it, and `\.`, that doesn't mean anything to R.

So, yes, you have to use `\\.` to detect a simple small period!

```r
str_view(texte,"\\.")
```

```
[1] │ Première phrase<.> Deuxième phrase<.>
```

A backslash at the level of R and a backslash at the level of the interpretation of the regex.

Now, if we prepare a character string with a backslash in it:

```r
bs <- "a\\b"
str_view(bs)
```

```
[1] │ a\b
```

How do we find it with a regex?

Yes, it will take us 4 backslashes to find just one.


```r
str_view(bs, "\\\\")
```

```
[1] │ a<\>b
```

When creating the character string in R, we lose 2 in encoding, then at the regex level, we lose the last one!

If we want to simplify our life a bit, we can remember that R allows us to create raw character strings, which do not go through the encoding stage:

```r
bs2 <- r"(a\n)"
str_view(bs2, r"(\\)")
```

```
[1] │ a<\>n
```

It's not ideal, but it eliminates at least one level of abstraction.

## Special characters
Just as regexes have their own syntax, they also include a series of special characters unique to them.

First, let's look at anchor characters. Regex include two anchor characters, `^` and `$` respectively designating the beginning and the end of a character string

For example, we can use an anchor to find all the names of mammals that end in squirrel, and thus eliminate the squirrel monkey from our results:

```r
str_view(noms, "squirrel")
```

```
[66] │ <squirrel> monkey
[70] │ arctic ground <squirrel>
[71] │ thirteen-lined ground <squirrel>
[72] │ golden-mantled ground <squirrel>
```
vs.

```r
str_view(noms, "squirrel$")
```

```
[70] │ arctic ground <squirrel>
[71] │ thirteen-lined ground <squirrel>
[72] │ golden-mantled ground <squirrel>
```

If we combine the two anchor characters, we ensure that the string contains only the requested text. Nothing more, nothing less.

```r
str_view(noms,"pig")
```

```
[12] │ guinea <pig>
[74] │ <pig>
```
vs.

```r
str_view(noms, "^pig$")
```

```
[74] │ <pig>
```

Regexes also include special characters allowing us to avoid long lists of characters. For example, you can use `\w` to find any letter or number.

So, to find all the species names composed of two words, we could do this:

```r
str_view(noms,"^\\w+ \\w+$")
```

```
 [2] │ <owl monkey>
 [3] │ <mountain beaver>
 [8] │ <vesper mouse>
[10] │ <roe deer>
[12] │ <guinea pig>
[19] │ <tree hyrax>
[21] │ <asian elephant>
[25] │ <european hedgehog>
[26] │ <patas monkey>
[28] │ <domestic cat>
[31] │ <pilot whale>
[32] │ <gray seal>
[33] │ <gray hyrax>
[35] │ <mongoose lemur>
[36] │ <african elephant>
[39] │ <mongolian gerbil>
[40] │ <golden hamster>
[42] │ <house mouse>
[45] │ <slow loris>
[55] │ <desert hedgehog>
... and 14 more
```

There are also a series of other similar characters, of which here is an overview:

* `\d` : any number
* `\D` : anything but a number
* `\s` : any space character (space, newline, indent)
* `\S` : everything except a space
* `\w` : any letter or number
* `\W` : anything that is not a letter or number

Beyond the characters `+`, `?` and `*`, regex also allow us finer control over the number of repetitions of a pattern, using braces. To find all names starting with a 3-letter word followed by a space, we could do this:

```r
str_view(noms,"^\\w{3}\\s")
```

```
 [2] │ <owl >monkey
[10] │ <roe >deer
[22] │ <big >brown bat
[83] │ <red >fox
```
Note that there is also a special character to detect borders around a word: `\b`.

If we want to find all the names containing a word of exactly 3 letters, we could do this:

```r
str_view(noms, "\\b\\w{3}\\b")
```

```
 [2] │ <owl> monkey
 [5] │ <cow>
 [7] │ northern <fur> seal
 [9] │ <dog>
[10] │ <roe> deer
[12] │ guinea <pig>
[16] │ african giant pouched <rat>
[22] │ <big> brown <bat>
[28] │ domestic <cat>
[43] │ little brown <bat>
[64] │ laboratory <rat>
[68] │ cotton <rat>
[69] │ mole <rat>
[74] │ <pig>
[82] │ arctic <fox>
[83] │ <red> <fox>
```

If only one number is given, the braces search for an exact number of detections, but you can also specify two values, which will give the upper and lower bounds for the acceptable number of detections.

For example, to find all animal names containing a 3 to 5 letter word, we would write this:

```r
str_view(noms, "\\b\\w{3,5}\\b")
```

```
 [2] │ <owl> monkey
 [4] │ greater <short>-tailed <shrew>
 [5] │ <cow>
 [6] │ <three>-<toed> <sloth>
 [7] │ northern <fur> <seal>
 [8] │ vesper <mouse>
 [9] │ <dog>
[10] │ <roe> <deer>
[11] │ <goat>
[12] │ guinea <pig>
[15] │ <star>-<nosed> <mole>
[16] │ african <giant> pouched <rat>
[17] │ lesser <short>-tailed <shrew>
[18] │ <long>-<nosed> armadillo
[19] │ <tree> <hyrax>
[20] │ <north> american opossum
[21] │ <asian> elephant
[22] │ <big> <brown> <bat>
[23] │ <horse>
[26] │ <patas> monkey
... and 37 more
```

## Operator precedence
As in mathematics, the evaluation of a regex does not necessarily occur from left to right. There is an order of priority between the operations.

As a general rule, characters controlling the number of repetitions take precedence over those defining alternatives.

For example `ab+` will be interpreted as `a(b+)`. `^a|b$` will be interpreted as `(^a)|(b$)`, etc.

Unlike algebra, these priorities are very difficult to remember, and the easiest way is probably to use as many parentheses as necessary to clarify the desired pattern.

## Groupings and reuse
Besides clarifying priorities, parentheses have another special use in regex: they create groups that can be reused. Each of the groups defined by the parentheses is numbered automatically by R. These numbers can then be used elsewhere in the regex. The first group will be named `\1`, the second `\2`, etc.

For example, we can find all the animals whose name contains a double letter, like this:

```r
str_view(noms,"(\\w)\\1")
```

```
 [1] │ ch<ee>tah
 [6] │ thr<ee>-toed sloth
[10] │ roe d<ee>r
[14] │ chinchi<ll>a
[17] │ le<ss>er short-tailed shrew
[18] │ long-nosed armadi<ll>o
[19] │ tr<ee> hyrax
[20] │ north american opo<ss>um
[30] │ gira<ff>e
[35] │ mong<oo>se lemur
[37] │ thick-tailed o<pp>osum
[43] │ li<tt>le brown bat
[47] │ northern gra<ss>ho<pp>er mouse
[48] │ ra<bb>it
[49] │ sh<ee>p
[50] │ chimpanz<ee>
[54] │ bab<oo>n
[56] │ po<tt>o
[57] │ d<ee>r mouse
[60] │ co<mm>on porpoise
... and 9 more
```

The `\w` grabs a letter, the parentheses create a group (here the number 1), and then a reuses that group to duplicate its value.

By the same principle, we can also find all the names that start and end with the same letter:

```r
str_view(noms,"^(\\w).*\\1$")
```

```
[10] │ <roe deer>
[12] │ <guinea pig>
[45] │ <slow loris>
[67] │ <eastern american mole>
```

Pattern reuse is also applicable with the `str_replace` function.

It can allow for example to reverse the first two words of each name:


```r
str_replace(noms,"^(\\w+)\\s(\\w+)(.*)", "\\2 \\1\\3")
```

Here we have 3 pairs of parentheses, so 3 groups. The first catches the first word (`\w+`), the second the second word (again `\w+`) and the last one catches everything else (`.*`). Then, we reconstruct a character string, but by placing the second group (`\2`) before the first (`\1`).

# Caution
As Spider-man says so well: With great power comes great responsibility.

This is especially true when talking about regexes. Better to go in moderation. It can sometimes be more readable for your future "you" to separate what you have to do into a few simple and readable operations, rather than trying to do everything in a single regex.

I present to you in conclusion a classic regex, used in a library of the Perl programming language to validate if an email address is valid or not (https://metacpan.org/release/RJBS/Email-Valid-1.200/source/lib/Email/Valid.pm) :
