# Mentoring

It is with pleasure that the RIVE’s Numérilab committee wishes to inform you that it will now be possible to 
request help / mentoring / coaching in statistics, programming and data analysis from the Numérilab, free 
of charge. The mentoring program is open to all students attached to a RIVE professor, from undergraduate 
to postgraduate, in order to facilitate progress in research (BIO1001-1006, master's, doctorate).

The mentoring meetings will take place in the form of one-hour one-to-one individual meetings, in person 
or remotely, and in compliance with the safety rules related to covid-19 in force. To receive this 
service, contact us at [numerilab@uqtr.ca](mailto:numerilab@uqtr.ca) with a brief description of your needs and we will put you 
in touch with one of our expert students.

If you would like to become a mentor, simply contact the committee at [numerilab@uqtr.ca](mailto:numerilab@uqtr.ca) with a short 
description of your digital expertise to be added to the list of volunteers.
